            Hi! I am Weizhen Liang. A Vancouver-based full stack web developer
            who loves building websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of
            Winnipeg. I am an experienced operations specialist with a
            demonstrated history of working in the hospitality and franchising
            industry. Recently decided to change my career to web development.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            I fell in love with coding during my gaming private server project
            that I was doing since 2018. Now I am ready and excited to turn my
            hobby into a career.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not coding, I play with my two little kids, find and fix
            bugs for my Ragnarok Online server.
